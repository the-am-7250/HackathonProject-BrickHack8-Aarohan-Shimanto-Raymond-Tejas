Dear Player,

It is with great to little regret that we have made the decision to terminate your employment here at
the team. We know we are stangers to eachother, which might make it harder to coach the team, but
We don't think that you truly love this job. You know the rules of the game and so do I, so
we both know that you have done a terrible job managing this team. You never put in a full
commitment of what we were thinking of for this team and the services you gave we could really get
from any other guy. That's why we have got to tell you how we feel so that you can understand.
Even though you have not succeeded with this team we hope you are never gonna give it up.
Even though you let us down by running around then deserting us. And please don't cry when we
say goodbye, but in the press conference we will lie about why we fired you.

Sincerly,
The Board
